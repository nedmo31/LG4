## Golf 4!
The latest in my series of making golf games in Java. 

## What's new?
 - 3 Dimensions: We're finally golfing in all three dimensions!
 - Leaderboards: There's no mulitplayer, but you can see how everyone else is doing on the courses you're playing, and try to get the best score
 - New hitting: Getting a good hit is a bit harder now. Your timing has to be good to get the right power and not to slice or hook your shot

## Updates
# 6/28/23
The work begins! 
# 7/1/23
Hitting has been implemented, but it's not very straightforward. Only one type of hole gets generated, and there is no hazards yet.
# 7/5/23
The backend server and database were deployed, so game client can now communicate with the server.
